1;"Nitrogen";"Nitrogen";"N";"Essential for plant growth, as it is a major part of chlorophyll. Nitrogen helps plants with rapid growth, increasing seed and fruit production and improving the quality of leaf and forage crops."
2;"Phosphorus";"Phosphorus";"P";"It is a part of the process of photosynthesis, aids in plant maturity, and contributes to the plant's yield."
3;"Potassium";"Potassium";"K";"Potassium improves overall vigor of the plant. It helps the plants to resist diseases, aids in photosynthesis, and in producing proteins."
4;"Calcium";"Calcium";"Ca";"Calcium improves general plant vigor and promotes early root formation and growth. It also helps in neutralizing cell acids."
5;"Magnesium";"Magnesium";"Mg";"Magnesium is crucial for seed germination and the production of chlorophyll, fruit, and seeds. It also aids in the absorption of phosphorus in the plant."
6;"Sulfur";"Sulfur";"S";"Sulfur is essential for the production of proteins and it aids in the formation of certain oils and volatile compounds."
7;"Iron";"Iron";"Fe";"Iron is essential for crop growth and food production. It aids in the synthesis of chlorophyll."
8;"Manganese";"Manganese";"Mn";"Manganese helps plants to break down carbohydrates and aids in nitrogen metabolism."
9;"Zinc";"Zinc";"Zn";"Zinc plays a considerable role in the growth of the plant, protein synthesis and energy production."
10;"Copper";"Copper";"Cu";"Copper aids in carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism. Insufficient copper results in stunting of plants."
11;"Boron";"Boron";"B";"Boron is used in cell wall formation and the development of reproductive parts of plants. It affects metabolism and the transport of sugars in plants."
12;"Molybdenum";"Molybdenum";"Mo";"Molybdenum is used by plants for the processing of nitrogen."
13;"Sodium";"Sodium";"Na";"Sodium can stimulate plant growth and improve plant resistance to diseases."
14;"Chlorine";"Chlorine";"Cl";"Chlorine is essential for photosynthesis process in plants."
15;"Selenium";"Selenium";"Se";"Selenium has an essential role in maintaining the integrity of plant cell membranes."
16;"Nickel";"Nickel";"Ni";"Nickel is essential for the activation of certain plant enzymes and also helps in the process of nitrogen assimilation."
17;"Cobalt";"Cobalt";"Co";"Cobalt is an essential component of several enzymes and co-enzymes. It has been shown to affect growth and metabolism of plants."
18;"Silicon";"Silicon";"Si";"Silicon helps in giving strength to plants and in resistance to insects and diseases."
19;"Vanadium";"Vanadium";"V";"Vanadium is believed to play a role in the regulation of enzyme activities in plants."
20;"Strontium";"Strontium";"Sr";"Strontium is thought to help in the formation and growth of plants."
